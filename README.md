# A Simple Password Generator With No Fluff!!!

I wanted to create a simple password generator that can generate long passwords quickly.

### The UI is extremely simple to use:
- Just use the slider to select the length of the password.
- Check or uncheck what you want in your passwords - **Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, Special Characters**.
- If you don't like the password that you see, just keep clicking **Generate password** to generate a new password with the same parameters you've selected.
- Quickly copy your passwords with the copy button.
- Create up to 128 character long passwords.

I've already made a [password generating extension](https://github.com/ooexiaoo/Password-Generator-Extension), but I thought most people wouldn't really want to install an extension that just generates passwords. It's like installing an app just to see use a webpage.

So this is the better option overall.

## Enjoy!
